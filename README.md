# Static Boilerplate

This is a simple boilerplate for static HTML pages with HTML, SCSS and ES2018 support.

## Tech

* Webpack for bundling
* Babel for JS
* SCSS for styles

## Usage

Clone the repository, and run `yarn` inside of the project folder to install all dependencies.
Edit the HTML files in the `views` folder. Run `yarn build` for development build, and `yarn build:prod` for production build.
